**Muse: A Text-to-Image Generation Model**

Muse is a text-to-image generation model that achieves state-of-the-art image generation performance while being significantly more efficient than diffusion or autoregressive models. The model is trained on a masked modeling task in discrete token space, where it predicts randomly masked image tokens given the text embedding extracted from a pre-trained large language model (LLM).

**Key Contributions:**

1. **Efficient Text-to-Image Generation**: Muse is significantly faster than comparable models due to the use of quantized image tokens and parallel decoding.
2. **Zero-Shot Image Editing**: Muse enables out-of-the-box, zero-shot editing capabilities including inpainting, outpainting, and mask-free editing.
3. **High-Quality Image Generation**: Muse achieves excellent FID and CLIP scores, indicating high-quality image generation and alignment with text prompts.

**Model Architecture:**

Muse consists of several sub-models:

1. **Pre-trained Text Encoders**: A pre-trained LLM is used to extract text embeddings, which are then used to condition the image generation process.
2. **Semantic Tokenization using VQGAN**: A VQGAN model is used to encode images into discrete tokens, which are then used as input to the image generation process.
3. **Base Model**: A masked transformer is used to predict masked image tokens given the text embedding and image tokens.
4. **Super-Resolution Model**: A transformer is used to upsample the base latent map to a higher-resolution latent map.

**Training and Evaluation:**

Muse is trained on the Imagen dataset and evaluated on the CC3M and COCO datasets. The model achieves state-of-the-art results on CC3M and competitive results on COCO.

**Image Editing:**

Muse enables zero-shot image editing capabilities, including inpainting, outpainting, and mask-free editing. The model can be used to edit real input images without fine-tuning or inverting the model.

**Related Work:**

Muse is related to other text-to-image generation models, including Imagen, Parti, and DALL-E 2. However, Muse is more efficient and achieves better results on certain metrics.

**Conclusion:**

Muse is a state-of-the-art text-to-image generation model that achieves high-quality image generation and efficient inference. The model enables zero-shot image editing capabilities and can be used for a variety of applications, including image generation and editing.
